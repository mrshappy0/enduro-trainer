# Enduro Trainer Frontend
<!-- Short Description -->
## Welcome to Enduro Trainer-Frontend!
The frontend of this app utilizes the JWT Rails Auth to ensure users must sign-in to access the protected resources. Once signed-in users have access to the To-Do list as well as the interactive leaflet map.

Using data employed from the backend. This app fetches trail data and conditions for the frontrange (Mountain Project API). This data can be seen in the map and interactively clicked on. Typically the Lat/Long used to make the markers shows the trail head.
