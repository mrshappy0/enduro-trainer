# Enduro Trainer Frontend
<!-- Short Description -->
## Welcome to Enduro Trainer-Frontend!
Welcome to Frontrange Enduro Trainer. This application features full authentication to protect user data. The objective of this app was to allow mountainbike enduro athletes a portal for them to save to-do lists, search trails in the frontrange and save them to their to-do list with full CRUD. The frontend was built with Vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap. The backend was built with Rails and JWT Authentication. The database is populated with trail information for the frontrange by using MountainProject's API.
